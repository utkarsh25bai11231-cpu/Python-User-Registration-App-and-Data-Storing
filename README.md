**Project Overview:**
This project focuses on developing a Python-based registration form that allows users to enter their personal details and stores the collected data for future use. Built using Python, the Registration Form allow users to input their ‘Name’ and ‘Email’, and also choose the ‘Password’ themselves, which is once verified again by letting write ‘Confirm Password’ to make sure the users have entered the password correctly which they thought to set up in.
The main goals of the project are:
•	To demonstrate how Python can be used to build a simple user interface, validate input fields, and store user data securely using local storage options such as text files, CSV, or a database.
•	to securely and persistently store this structured data in an integrated database, ensuring data integrity and future retrieval.

**Project Outlines:**
	This document outlines the design and implementation of an “User Registration Form”  dedicated to the Administrative forms intake, such as Government Jobs, Institutional application for admissions, applying for an interview, online/offline competitions, Lucky Draw forms, creating a digital account in banks or on any digital services like Gmail etc.
	Some important key outlines are:
•  Overview of the registration form system.
•  Purpose of creating a Python-based application for collecting and storing user data.
•  Importance of automated data collection in small applications and learning environments.
•	Build a scalable foundation for future enhancements.

**Key Features**:
The application includes many core functionalities. Some of them are:
✔	Graphical User Interface (GUI): 
   A clean, intuitive form layout created using a standard Python GUI library (like kivy) to ensure ease of use.
✔	User Input Fields: Dedicated fields for capturing essential information, including:
  •	Full Name
  •	Email Address
  •	Password (and Confirm Password)
✔ User-Friendly Registration Form: 
   •	A clean and simple user interface for entering registration details.
✔ Input Validation:
   •	Checks for empty fields, valid email format, password length, and numeric inputs where required.
✔ Secure Password Handling (Optional Enhancement): 
   	Password can be dotted or hashed before storing for better security.
✔ Data Storage:
   •	Stores user data in a chosen format:
         o	Text File
         o	CSV File
         o	SQLite Database (optional enhancement)
   •	Displays confirmation when the user registers successfully.
✔ Success & Error Messages:
  •	Alerts the user if incorrect or incomplete details are entered.
✔ Modular Code Structure:
  •	Easy-to-read and maintainable code using functions.

**Tools Used:**
i.	Python 3.13 64-bit
ii.	Basic Python concepts:
    	Functions such as import, def, layout…
    	GUI Framework (kivy)
    	Database (SQLite3)
    	Conditional statements and use of if-elif-else
    	Loops
    	Operations
    	Lists 
    	User input handling

**Steps to Run the Program:**
To run and execute the Python program on your system, follow the steps below: 
1.	Install Python:
     Ensure that Python 3.13 64-bit or 32-bit is installed and set-up on your system.
2.	Create a Python File:
       Save the provided source code in a directory on your system as:
                              registration_app.py
3.	Run the program:
      Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the file is saved and run:
                   python registration_app.py
4. 	Use the Menu options:
   Fill Out the Registration Form:
              You will see a menu (Registration Form) like this-
              i.	Name
              ii.	Email
              iii.	Password
              iv.	Confirm Password
               v.	Register
   Enter the corresponding number to perform an action.
5.	Check Stored Data:
    Open the generated storage file to verify that user data is saved properly.

**Finish the Report:**
The Python User Registration App successfully demonstrates how to create a lightweight and accessible user interface and it also demonstrated effective database connection, table management, and the execution of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, specifically the Create operation. 
The implementation of data validation ensures that only correctly formatted and complete records are committed to the database, enhancing the application's reliability. 
As mentioned above, the project successfully achieves its purpose of:
    •	Collecting user input through a functional graphical interface.
    •	Saving the data securely in a structured format. 
  This serves as an excellent foundation for more advanced systems like user authentication modules, application dashboards, or full-scale management systems.
Significance on users:
   The project is ideal for beginners who want to strengthen their python fundamentals and get familiar with real-world program flow.
